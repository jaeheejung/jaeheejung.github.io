Outside of my book project, I research on other aspects of party competition, such as valence attacks, issue position shifts, and constituency campaigning. These projects investigate previously under-explored aspects of party-voter relations. 

Moreover, I have a separate line of research on norms and public opinion. I investigate how signals about social norms affect voter attitudes on issues such as abortion, gender equality, and gay rights.

Most recently, I have started working with Professors [Pepper Culpepper](http://www.pepperculpepper.net) and [Taeku Lee](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/taeku-lee) on an ERC-funded project titled "Banks, Popular Backlash, and the Post-Crisis Politics of Financial Regulation." We are conducting surveys and survey experiments in six countries (Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the US) to examine how different media frames on bank bailouts affect voter attitudes toward elites and politics.
