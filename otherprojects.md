Outside of my book project, I research on other aspects of party competition, such as valence attacks, issue position shifts, and constituency campaigning. These projects investigate previously under-explored aspects of party-voter relations. 

Moreover, I have a separate line of research on norms and public opinion. I investigate how signals about social norms affect voter attitudes on issues such as abortion, gender equality, and LGBT rights.

Most recently, I have started working with Professors [Pepper Culpepper](http://www.pepperculpepper.net) and [Taeku Lee](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/taeku-lee) on a project titled "BANK-LASH: Banks, Popular Backlash, and the Post-Crisis Politics of Financial Regulation," funded by the European Research Council. We are conducting nationally representative panel surveys and survey experiments in six countries (Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the US) to examine how different media frames on banking scandals affect voter behaviors and attitudes toward elites and other sociopolitical issues.
