My primary research agenda is on morality in politics, specifically moral rhetoric in party competition. I examine how moral rhetoric looks like in party campaigns, what its effects are on voters, and how voters think of moral argumentation, among other things. I study these topics from a comparative perspective. One of the outputs of this research agenda will be a book manuscript on moral rhetoric in party campaigns.

Outside of morality and politics, I research on other aspects of party competition, such as valence attacks, issue position shifts, and constituency campaigning. These projects investigate previously under-explored aspects of party-voter relations. 

Moreover, I have a separate line of research on norms, stereotypes, and public opinion. I investigate how signals about social norms and counter-stereotypes affect people's attitudes on issues such as abortion, gender equality, and LGBTQ rights.

Most recently, I have started working with Professors [Pepper Culpepper](http://www.pepperculpepper.net) and [Taeku Lee](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/taeku-lee) on a project titled "BANK-LASH: Banks, Popular Backlash, and the Post-Crisis Politics of Financial Regulation," funded by the European Research Council. We are conducting nationally representative panel surveys and survey experiments in six countries (Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the US) to examine how different media frames on banking scandals affect voter behaviors and attitudes toward elites, financial regulation, and other sociopolitical issues.
