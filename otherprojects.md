Outside of my dissertation, I research on other aspects of party competition, such as valence attacks, issue position shifts, and constituency campaigning. These projects investigate previously under-explored dimensions of party-voter relations. 

Moreover, I have a separate line of research on norms and public opinion. I investigate how signals about social norms affect voter attitudes on issues such as abortion, gender equality, and gay rights.
