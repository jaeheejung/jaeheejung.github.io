Outside of my dissertation, I research on other aspects of party competition, such as valence attacks, issue position shifts, and constituency campaigning. These projects investigate previously under-explored dimensions of party-voter relations. 

Moreover, I have a separate line of research on norms and public opinion. I investigate how signals about social norms affect voter attitudes on issues such as abortion, gender equality, and gay rights.

Most recently, I have started working with Professors [Pepper Culpepper](http://www.pepperculpepper.net) and [Taeku Lee](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/taeku-lee) on an ERC-funded project titled "Banks, Popular Backlash, and the Post-Crisis Politics of Financial Regulation."
