<p>Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Survey Research at the <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk">Blavatnik School of Government</a> and a Non-Stipendiary Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>. My research interests are in comparative party politics, political behavior, and political pyschology, with a focus on party campaigns, party rhetoric, voter behavior, and voter attitudes in Western democracies. I frequently use survey experiments in my work.</p>

<p>In elections, parties do not simply state what their policy positions are, but explain and justify why they hold such positions. However, the rhetorical tools that parties use to appeal to voters have received scant attention in comparative party research. Focusing on moral rhetoric, my dissertation overcomes the theoretical and empirical challenges of studying rhetoric in a comparative context. Drawing insights from political and moral psychology and using text analyses, experiments, and survey analyses, I investigate the power and the limits of moral appeals in mobilizing voters. One of the goals of my dissertation, which is a book project, is to push the boundaries of comparative party research by introducing the concept of moral rhetoric to the study of party strategies.</p>
	
<p>I received my PhD from the <a href="https://polisci.wustl.edu">Department of Political Science</a> at <a href="https://wustl.edu">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. Before graduate school, I studied at Underwood International College of Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. I received a BA in Political Science and International Relations with highest honors.</p>
