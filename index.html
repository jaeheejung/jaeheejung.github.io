<p>Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Survey Research at the <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk">Blavatnik School of Government</a> and a Non-Stipendiary Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>. My research interests are in comparative party politics, political behavior, and political pyschology, with a focus on party campaigns, party rhetoric, voter behavior, and voter attitudes in Western democracies. I frequently use survey experiments in my work.</p>

<p>The fundamental question that underpins my work is how the informational environment influences voters. In that spirit, I have three lines of research. First, I have solo and coauthored projects that examine the effects of political parties’ campaign messages on voters’ attitudes and behaviors. My book project, which builds on my dissertation, falls under this theme. Second, I have coauthored papers that investigate how signals about social norms affect voters' sociopolitical attitudes. The papers explore this question in the context of norms and attitudes about gender and sexuality. Third, I am working on a project that examines how newspaper articles' frames about a policy area shape voters’ attitudes and behaviors about the issue area. My collaborators and I are examining messages about banking scandals and financial regulation.</p>

<p>I received my PhD from the <a href="https://polisci.wustl.edu">Department of Political Science</a> at <a href="https://wustl.edu">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. Before graduate school, I studied at <a href="https://uic.yonsei.ac.kr/main/default.asp">Underwood International College</a> of <a href="https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp">Yonsei University</a> in Seoul, South Korea. I received a BA in Political Science and International Relations with highest honors.</p>
