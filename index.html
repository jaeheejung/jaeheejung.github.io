<p>Welcome! I am Postdoctoral Fellow in Survey Research at the <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk">Blavatnik School of Government</a> and Non-Stipendiary Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk">Nuffield College</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>. My research interests are in comparative party politics, political behavior, and political psychology, with a focus on party campaigns, party rhetoric, voter attitudes, and voter behavior in Western democracies. I frequently use surveys and survey experiments in my work.</p>

<p>The fundamental question that underpins my work is how the informational environment influences voters. In that spirit, I have three lines of research. First, I have solo and coauthored projects that examine the effects of political parties’ campaign messages on voters’ attitudes and behaviors. My primary focus in this area is parties' use of moral rhetoric. Second, I have coauthored papers that investigate how signals about social norms and stereotypes affect people's sociopolitical attitudes. The papers explore this question in the context of attitudes about abortion, gender, and sexual minorities. Third, I am working on a large-scale project that examines how newspaper articles' frames about a policy area shape voters’ attitudes and behaviors about the issue area. My collaborators and I are examining messages about bank scandals and financial regulation. Some of my work on these topics has been published in the <i>American Journal of Politics Science</i>, <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion & Parties</i>, and <i>Journal of Politics</i>.</p>

<p>I received my PhD from the <a href="https://polisci.wustl.edu">Department of Political Science</a> at <a href="https://wustl.edu">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. Before graduate school, I studied at <a href="https://uic.yonsei.ac.kr/main/default.asp">Underwood International College</a> of <a href="https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp">Yonsei University</a> in Seoul, South Korea. I received a BA in Political Science and International Relations with highest honors.</p>
