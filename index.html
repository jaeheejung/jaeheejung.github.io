<p>I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Survey Research at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My research interests are in comparative party politics and political behavior, with a focus on party campaigns, party rhetoric, voter behavior, and voter attitudes in advanced democracies.</p>

<p>In elections, parties do not simply state what their policy positions are, but explain and justify why they hold such positions. However, the rhetorical tools that parties use to appeal to voters have received scant attention in comparative party research. Focusing on moral rhetoric, my dissertation overcomes the theoretical and empirical challenges of studying rhetoric in a comparative context. Drawing insights from political and moral psychology and using text analyses, experiments, and survey analyses, I investigate the power and the limits of moral appeals in mobilizing voters. One of the goals of my dissertation, which is a book project, is to push the boundaries of comparative party research by introducing the concept of moral rhetoric to the study of party strategies.</p>

<p>Outside of my dissertation, I research on other aspects of party competition, such as valence attacks, issue position shifts, and constituency campaigning. These projects investigate previously under-explored dimensions of party-voter relations. Moreover, I have a separate line of research on norms and public opinion. I investigate how signals about social norms affect voter attitudes on issues such as abortion, gender equality, and gay rights.</p>

<p>My teaching interests are in comparative politics and quantitative methods. I am passionate about teaching and have received formalized training in pedagogy. I was the instructor for undergraduate-level Introduction to Comparative Politics in Fall 2017. I also worked as teaching assistant for a number of courses, including Quantitative Political Methodology.</p>

<p>Before starting graduate school, I studied at Underwood International College of Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. I received a BA in Political Science and International Relations with highest honors.</p>
